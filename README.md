# Pseudo-classes-and-elements
This is a page I created for testing pseudo classes and elements.

## Inspiration  

'When you're up to your butt in alligators, it's hard to remember you just came to drain the swamp!'

This all started when I started learning semantic HTML. As I learned about new elements  
I had not used before, I also became aware of CSS properties I was not familar with.
This project is another attempt at coding up what I've learned.
